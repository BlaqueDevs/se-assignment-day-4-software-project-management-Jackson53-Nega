Using EVM to monitor project performance, and provide early detection of variances.   

Budget Establishment
Creating a clear and well defined budget, before the project begins.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?


Waterfall - A linear, sequential approach where each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment) must be completed before the next begins.

Advantages
Clear structure and predictable progress.
Well-defined documentation.
Suitable for projects with stable requirements.

Disadvantages
Inflexible; difficult to accommodate changes.
Testing occurs late in the process, potentially delaying issue detection.
Limited customer involvement during development.

Agile - An iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility and adaptability.
Focuses on collaboration, customer feedback, and continuous improvement.

Advantages
Highly adaptable to changing requirements.
Frequent customer feedback and involvement.
Early and continuous testing.

Disadvantages
Less predictable timelines and budgets.
Requires active customer involvement.
Can be challenging to manage for large, complex projects.

Key Differences
Flexibility: Agile is highly flexible, while Waterfall is rigid.
Customer Involvement: Agile encourages continuous customer involvement, while Waterfall's involvement is primarily at the beginning and end.
Change Management: Agile easily accommodates changes, while Waterfall resists them.
Testing: Agile integrates testing throughout the process, while Waterfall typically tests at the end.
Planning: Waterfall relies on extensive upfront planning, while Agile's planning is iterative.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile
Best for:
Projects with evolving requirements.
